Molecular Graphs
----------------

To work on molecular graphs, make sure you have installed `RDKit 2018.09.3 <https://www.rdkit.org/docs/Install.html>`__.

Featurization
`````````````

For the use of graph neural networks, we need to featurize nodes (atoms) and edges (bonds). Below we list some
featurization methods/utilities:

.. autosummary::
    :toctree: ../../generated/

    chem.one_hot_encoding
    chem.atom_type_one_hot
    chem.atom_degree_one_hot
    chem.atom_implicit_valence_one_hot
    chem.atom_hybridization_one_hot
    chem.atom_total_num_H_one_hot
    chem.atom_formal_charge
    chem.atom_num_radical_electrons
    chem.atom_is_aromatic
    chem.BaseAtomFeaturizer
    chem.ConcatAtomFeaturizer
    chem.CanonicalAtomFeaturizer

Graph Construction
``````````````````

Several methods for constructing DGLGraphs from SMILES/RDKit molecule objects are listed below:

.. autosummary::
    :toctree: ../../generated/

    chem.mol_to_graph
    chem.smiles_to_bigraph
    chem.mol_to_bigraph
    chem.smiles_to_complete_graph
    chem.mol_to_complete_graph

Dataset Classes
```````````````

If your dataset is stored in a ``.csv`` file, you may find it helpful to use

.. autoclass:: dgl.data.chem.CSVDataset
    :members: __getitem__, __len__

Currently two datasets are supported:

* Tox21
* TencentAlchemyDataset

.. autoclass:: dgl.data.chem.Tox21
    :members: __getitem__, __len__, task_pos_weights

.. autoclass:: dgl.data.chem.TencentAlchemyDataset
    :members: __getitem__, __len__, set_mean_and_std
