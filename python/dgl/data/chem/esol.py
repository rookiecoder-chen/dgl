class ESOL(CSVDataset):
    """ESOL dataset.

    ESOL is a small dataset consisting of water solubility data for 1128 compounds.
    The dataset has been used to train models that estimate solubility directly from
    chemical structures (as encoded in SMILES strings). Note that these structures
    donâ€™t include 3D coordinates, since solubility is a property of a molecule and
    not of its particular conformers.

    All molecules are converted into DGLGraphs. After the first-time construction,
    the DGLGraphs will be saved for reloading so that we do not need to reconstruct them everytime.

    Parameters
    ----------
    smiles_to_graph: callable, str -> DGLGraph
        A function turning smiles into a DGLGraph.
        Default to :func:`dgl.data.chem.smiles_to_bigraph`.
    atom_featurizer : callable, rdkit.Chem.rdchem.Mol -> dict
        Featurization for atoms in a molecule, which can be used to update
        ndata for a DGLGraph. Default to None.
    bond_featurizer : callable, rdkit.Chem.rdchem.Mol -> dict
        Featurization for bonds in a molecule, which can be used to update
        edata for a DGLGraph. Default to None.
